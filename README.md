A copy (likely not the only version) of a general template for
a Columbia University Astronomy PhD thesis. This current version
is a very minorly modified version of what has been handed down 
along a long line of people stretching all the way back to the Stone Age... 
or something like that.... For posterity, the line of succession from 
`thesis.tex` is copied below.

I've added a Makefile to make compiling / cleaning up easy.

`$ make pdf` will compile the whole thing. `$ make clean` will clean up.
